                        I’m growing up I want to be a sailor<br>
                        I’m wishing for a giant arena, a stream<br>

                    <h5><span>The Cherished Daughter</span> <br> translated by Nguyen Ngoc Bich</h5>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Reflection</h5>
                    <p><span>"The Cherished Daughter"</span> is a touching poem that explores the life of a daughter who is battling the societal and familial expectations associated with marriage. This story skillfully conveys the importance of tradition and the demands made on young people, especially women, to adhere to a predetermined timeframe for marriage. A girl who finds herself caught in the crossfire of these expectations as she gets older is vividly portrayed in the poem. Arranged weddings have a long history in Vietnam, as they do in many other countries, and because of this, people may feel strongly compelled to follow the rules of these arrangements. <br> The poem's repeated requests are a literary device that conveys the speaker's despair. The daughter's inner torment is made visible through these appeals as she struggles with conflicting aspirations and social pressure to fit in. The poem's central conflict between traditional expectations and personal wants makes it a poignant examination of the challenges posed by negotiating cultural and familial customs. It's a story that many people can identify with since it illuminates the common difficulty of balancing personal aspirations with the pressure of cultural rules.  </p>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Themes and Cultural Context</h5>
                    <p>	The narrative's overarching topic centers on the enormous demands society places on people, especially women, to adhere to accepted conventions when it comes to marriage. Generative interactions take center stage in this overarching theme's intricate tapestry. The complex relationships between the daughter and her mother shed light on the persisting dynamics that exist between generations, emphasizing how societal expectations frequently endure and impact the lives of daughters in a manner similar to how they have shaped the lives of their mothers. A number of cultural symbols, including matchmakers, the quan (a unit of weight), areca nuts, and other particular objects, are delicately included into the story. </p>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Symbolism</h5>
                    <p>A number of cultural symbols, including matchmakers, the quan (a unit of weight), areca nuts, and other particular objects, are delicately included into the story. These aspects add to the story's cultural richness and probably draw on the diverse range of cultural customs surrounding marriage negotiations, some of which may have their roots in a particular custom or local setting. <br>
                        The increased demands represent the daughter's growing difficulty or problems in finding a compatible partner. They might also represent the gradual tightening of societal expectations.</p>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Literary Techniques Used</h5>
                    <p>Due to word repetition or rhyming, the poem is of the lyric poetry variety. To make the poetry more comprehensible and consistent, the thoughts of the poems are condensed into a single pattern.   The poem depicts the close bond between a mother and her daughter, whose sentiments and emotions are made plainly apparent by the lines in each stanza. Additionally, the poem makes use of figurative language to enhance and emphasize its themes.</p>

                    <h5><span>A School Boy’s Apology</span> <br>by Le Thanh Huan</h5>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Reflection</h5>
                    <p>A young boy dealing with the negative impacts of war on his life is depicted in <span>"A School Boy's Apology"</span>. This succinct yet impactful tale depicts not just his genuine regret for his behavior in class but also the deep anxiety he harbors about possibly annoying or disrupting others. This straightforward gesture of remorse goes beyond the bounds of an ordinary schoolboy's regret and becomes a symbol of how war has robbed children in conflict zones of their innocence and aspirations.<br>
                        The boy's concern for upsetting his class is a reflection of how much life has been disrupted by conflict. It's a powerful remark on the harsh reality that people—especially children—who are forced into chaotic, violent surroundings must deal with. The book serves as a sobering reminder of the collateral damage that armed war causes to children, inflicting scars that extend beyond physical trauma and eroding their dreams, innocence, and capacity to simply be children.
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Themes and Cultural Context</h5>
                    <p>	The poem's main theme is the terrible toll that war takes on individuals, and it does so by graphically describing how it steals a little boy's innocence and shatters his hopes. As the poem takes us on a journey through the boy's life, from hopeful childhood dreams to the harsh, cruel reality of war, this loss of innocence serves as a prominent theme. His childhood fantasies and the carnage and chaos of war stand in stark contrast, serving as a sobering reminder of the toll that war has on the human soul. This universal theme is especially fascinating because it cuts across cultural barriers and resonates with people from all walks of life who have personally felt the effects of conflict.
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Symbolism</h5>
                    <p>The repeated imagery of the "Fires of War" acts as a forceful symbol throughout the poem, signifying the constant danger that war poses to the little boy's hopes and happiness. The boy's world has been completely consumed by the unrelenting onslaught of conflict, which is powerfully depicted by these fires, which stand for destruction and chaos. They offer a stark contrast to the pure aspirations of his youth. Additionally, the poem's repeated references to "Guns and Crash of Steel" serve as a metaphor for the violence and struggle that have crept into the boy's existence. These components emphasize the harsh reality he must face as well as the loss of innocence. </p>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Literary Techniques Used</h5>
                    <p>The first-person perspective is used in the poem is an essential component that greatly heightens the reader's emotional response. By taking on this viewpoint, the poet directly engages the listeners in the narrator's personal experiences, forging a deeper and more personal bond. We are able to put ourselves in the narrator's shoes and experience the hardships of war through their eyes because "I" and "my" are used frequently in the text. This intimacy increases the poem's emotional power since readers become active participants in the emotional journey rather than merely observers.</p>

                    <h5><span>Inside Submarines</span><br> by Phan Nhien Hao tr. Linh Dinh</h5>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Reflection</h5>
                    <p>The poem <span>“Inside Submarines”</span> is a metaphorical representation of the human experience. The submarine represents our individual life and the ocean surround it is the world around us. The line “chasing after secrets and the darkness of the ocean” highlights how humans have an innate yearning to venture into uncharted territories, even when they know it might be intimidating or risky. Additionally, the poem also tenderly explores the concept that, deep down, we're all interconnected, like threads woven into the fabric of existence. It gently reminds us that our survival and flourishing are intrinsically tied to the support and companionship we offer and receive from one another.</p>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Themes and Symbolism</h5>
                    <p>	The theme of the poem is to highlight the boundaries of human vision and knowledge, embodying our particular journeys confined by the limits of what we can experience and comprehend. <br>
                        Moreover, the submarines symbolize our unique life experiences and the inherent boundaries that confine us. The boundless expanse of the ocean mirrors the vast, enigmatic nature of our external world, filled with uncharted territories.
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Cultural Context</h5>
                    <p>In the line “An abode of peace” implies that Brunei provides its citizens and residents with a safe and secure environment, free from the constant fear of violence and crime. This phrase underscores the nation's commitment to maintaining law and order.
